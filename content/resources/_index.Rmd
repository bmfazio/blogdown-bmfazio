title: Resources

I need to figure out a way to throw folders inside the `/resource` folder and automatically list them here with some nice title. The main (and perhaps only) use I have in mind for this section is to list content I create via **bookdown**.

`r paste0("<h2>",dir(paste0(blogdown:::site_root(),"/content/resources")),"</h2>")`
