## About me

Hi!

My name is Boris.

I studied biology in college but statistics caught my attention along the way. Most of the time I'm helping other researchers analyze their data.

## About this site

My main motivation for setting up a blog is to document my progress and sporadically publish personal musings. Even if nobody ever sees them, I feel more compelled to write here than I would be on some notebook which will never leave my room. Kind of like sending a message in a bottle, I suppose.
