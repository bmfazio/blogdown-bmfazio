<h2>About me</h2>
<p>Hi!</p>
<p>My name is Boris.</p>
<p>I studied biology in college but statistics caught my attention along the way. Most of the time Iâ€™m helping other researchers analyze their data.</p>
</div>
<div id="about-this-site" class="section level2">
<h2>About this site</h2>
<p>My main motivation for setting up a blog is to document my progress and sporadically publish personal musings. Even if nobody ever sees them, I feel more compelled to write here than I would be on some notebook which will never leave my room. Kind of like sending a message in a bottle, I suppose.</p>
