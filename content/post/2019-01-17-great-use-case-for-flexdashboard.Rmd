Found this [blog post](https://jenthompson.me/2018/02/09/flexdashboards-monitoring/) by [Jennifer Thompson](https://twitter.com/jent103) today, thanks to the flurry of great content being shared on Twitter during #rstudioconf. It's about making dashboards with the `flexdashboard` R package, with an application to monitoring clinical research.

I'm definitely going to be using this at some point.
