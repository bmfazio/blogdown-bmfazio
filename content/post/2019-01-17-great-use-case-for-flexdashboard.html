<p>Found this <a href="https://jenthompson.me/2018/02/09/flexdashboards-monitoring/">blog post</a> from Jennifer Thompson today, thanks to the flurry of great content being shared on Twitter during #rstudioconf.</p>
<p>Iâ€™ve already been asked to help put together monitoring tools for human cohorts before and no doubt will be in the future. This will no doubt come in handy!</p>
