<p>Found this <a href="https://jenthompson.me/2018/02/09/flexdashboards-monitoring/">blog post</a> by <a href="https://twitter.com/jent103">Jennifer Thompson</a> today, thanks to the flurry of great content being shared on Twitter during #rstudioconf. It’s about making dashboards with the <code>flexdashboard</code> R package, with an application to monitoring clinical research.</p>
<p>I’m definitely going to be using this at some point.</p>
