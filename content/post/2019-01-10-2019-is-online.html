<p>I have been meaning to set up a personal blog for probably over a year now and I’ve finally found the time to do so. I probably could have done this a few months ago if I hadn’t spent so much time agonizing over choosing between <a href="https://jekyllrb.com/">Jekyll</a> and <a href="https://gohugo.io/">Hugo</a>, as well as finding the ideal theme.</p>
<p>Although some of that time was certainly spent on unnecessary nitpicking, I think it was worth it as I ultimately feel I made a comfortably informed choice. I will lay out my reasoning here, mostly as an exercise in documenting my actions but also on the off chance I ever need to share my thoughts on the matter with someone else.</p>

<h2>How I found Jekyll and then dropped it for Hugo</h2>
<p>I have been using GitHub for a few years and at some point discovered they offered free hosting for static websites. I went to <a href="https://pages.github.com/">GitHub Pages</a> to find out more and diligently followed each step until I reached the bottom. If you do that, you’ll notice that one of the links entices you with the possibility of setting up a blog using Jekyll.</p>
<p>As I didn’t know of any other alternatives, I went with that. The <a href="https://jekyllrb.com/docs/step-by-step/01-setup/">introductory tutorial</a> was quite easy to follow and I had a test site running in no time. Even with my, at the time, nonexistent webdev knowledge, I quickly understood how templates and content came together into a full website, by letting the user focus on content and giving them a limited set of options that the engine would then systematically transform into HTML. A very exciting revelation!</p>
<p>Anyway, then came the very crucial issue of picking a theme. I probably spent more time on that than I did on the tutorial. I’m not entirely sure how, but at some point I arrived at <a href="https://forestry.io/">Forestry.io</a> and saw that there was another choice called Hugo. That rang some bells, as I remembered seeing it mentioned on Twitter, probably by some of the several R users I follow due to the <a href="https://bookdown.org/yihui/blogdown/">blogdown</a> package. And just like that, the seed of doubt was sown in me, so now I had to do additional research.</p>
<p>Thankfully, <a href="https://forestry.io/blog/hugo-vs-jekyll-benchmark/">this article</a> was one of the first search results, and it made a fairly compelling case for Hugo over Jekyll.</p>
