<p>Today I came across an excellent thread by <a href="https://twitter.com/ADAlthousePhD/">Andrew Althouse</a> on whether it makes sense to blind the Data and Safety Monitoring Board (DSMB) in a RCT (it doesn’t). The main reason is provided in this tweet:</p>

<p>Dr. Althouse provides three situations where the DSMB might want to stop a trial early:</p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Efficacy:</strong> When there’s enough evidence that a treatment is benefitial. Continuing with the protocol would deny those in the control arm from receiving the better option.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Safety:</strong> When there’s enough evidence that a treatment is harmful. Continuing with the protocol would knowingly put treatment arm participants at risk.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Futility:</strong> When there’s not enough evidence that a treatment is effective and the information that would be gleaned from the remainder of the experiment is unlikely to change this assessment. Continuing with the protocol would be a waste of resources which could presumably be used to test more promising alternatives.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>The key realization here is that, under blinded monitoring, a decision can only be made in terms of <strong>1)</strong> the size of the difference and <strong>2)</strong> the precision of the estimated difference.</p>
<p>At any given “checkpoint” by the DSMB, the study should only continue if enough precision has not yet been obtained to meet any of the stoppage criteria. If the difference is only very small but that estimate is sufficiently precise, then we would have futility stoppage. On the other hand, under both efficacy or safety criteria, the same large difference would have to trigger stoppage and the direction would only be known after blinding is lifted.</p>
<p>As quoted above, the strength of evidence for benefit must be high to warrant early stoppage and blinding forces a symmetry that would require just as strong evidence of harm which is a patently bad idea.</p>
